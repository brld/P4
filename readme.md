## Description

This project allows users to generate various things that would be helpful to a developer, such as filler lorem ipsum text, randomly generated users, or easy to remember xkcd passwords. This project makes use of the MVC pattern (Model, view, controller) and uses Laravel 5's controllers, routes, and views.

## Details for the teaching team

Navigation bar is global across all pages for easy navigation after generating anything.

All HTML and CSS validates with no warnings.

The logo was made by me.

The phone numbers for random users are not toll free as toll free numbers were not functional.

NOTE: I had to URL encode the | character for importing google fonts with %7C in order to prevent an HTML error.
