# Scout Manager

## Description

Scout Manager is your Boy Scout troop's online database for all books and equipment. This means that you can easily borrow anything for however long you need it.

The application is designed for easy access to items through the database, and shows the owner of every item so that you can easily retrieve it.

## Details for the teaching team

If this were a real world project, then after someone electronically borrowed a book or item, it would be delivered by the previous owner. Just putting that out there cause I can't simulate real world interactions in a database.

I had to URL encode the | character for importing google fonts with %7C in order to prevent an HTML error.

All emails pipe to the live server's 'storage/logs/laravel.log', as the two seeded user emails 'jill@harvard.edu' and 'jamal@harvard.edu' are not real emails.

## Features

* Ability to edit books and equipment easily
* Tags that categorize books and equipment
* Newest books and equipment section
* Search the entire database with AJAX
* Confirmation emails sent when borrowing anything
* Login and registering
