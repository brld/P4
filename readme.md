## Description

Scout Manager is your Boy Scout troop's online database for all books and equipment. This means that you can easily borrow anything for however long you need it.

The application is designed for easy access to items through the database, and shows the owner of every item so that you can easily retrieve it.

## Details for the teaching team

Note: Although this project is largely database based, in order for it to fully make sense, there must be an assumption that previous owners and new owners will collaborate somewhat outside of the database (i.e. after book is borrowed and confirmation email is sent, the book will be delivered manually). This is simply because this deals with real books and items, and not e-books.

NOTE: I had to URL encode the | character for importing google fonts with %7C in order to prevent an HTML error.
